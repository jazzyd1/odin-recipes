This is a practice project needed to check and recollect what i have learn so far in html-foundation course in TOP.
I am hoping to utilise all the stuff learnt so far and build on them as time goes on. These will include:
- creating index files for webpages using htlm
- creating links to other resources
- adding italics and bold letters
-
